# Weather App

## Overview

The Weather App is a web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specific location. Users can obtain weather information either by entering the name of a city or by providing coordinates (latitude and longitude). This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.

## Features

- Option to get the weather for the user's current location using geolocation.

   - For "City Name," type the name of the city (e.g., "Orlando") and click the "Get City Weather" button.
   - For "Coordinates," provide the latitude and longitude (e.g., 28.54, -81.38), and click the "Get Weather" button.
4. View the weather information displayed on the screen, including the weather description, temperature, humidity, high and low temperatures, sunrise, sunset, and a weather icon.
